# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
book_library/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
book_library/db/*.sqlite3
book_library/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
book_library/log/*
book_library/tmp/*
!book_library/log/.keep
!book_library/tmp/.keep
