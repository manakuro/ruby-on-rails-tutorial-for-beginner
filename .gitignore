# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/book_library/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/book_library/db/*.sqlite3
/book_library/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/book_library/log/*
/book_library/tmp/*
!/book_library/log/.keep
!/book_library/tmp/.keep

/book_library/node_modules
/book_library/yarn-error.log

/book_library/.byebug_history
